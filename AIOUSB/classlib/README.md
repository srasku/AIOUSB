* ATTENTION

This API is deprecated by ACCES I/O Products Inc. We are unable to devote our 
mental compute cycles to maintaining the C++ wrapper code for our existing C
code.  

We are keeping this directory for legacy customers but we urge new adopters of our
Hardware and Software to use only the C API which is under ../lib.  We
provide better support and coverage for that library and will make
sure that it can be compiled in a manner that will still suit C++
developers.  In addition, if you are looking to develop an
application in a language other than C or C++ we provide a wrappers
directory that includes support for Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, R , Php,
Octave and Matlab.


We apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused,


Sincerely,

The ACCES I/O Products Software team.
